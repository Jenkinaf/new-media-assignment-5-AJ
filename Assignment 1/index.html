            Sloths are an incredibly important part of the tropical rain forest ecosystem.
            They spend most of their lives in the canopies, sleeping and remaining hidden 
            from possible predators. 
            Sloths are solitary animals and are able to travel from tree to tree using the canopy vines.
            Sloths have an extremely slow matabalism, which causes them to not be able to move very quickly.
            Sloths on average only move about 41 yards per day, which is less than half of a football feild.
