            Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains, vast monuments,
            and sophisticated cities, all of which have made it a favoured travel destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spain occupies most of the Iberian Peninsula, stretching south from the Pyrenees Mountains to the Strait of
            Gibraltar, which separates Spain from Africa.
            It occupies about 85 percent of the Iberian Peninsula, which it shares with its smaller neighbour Portugal.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the east lies the Mediterranean Sea, including Spain's Balearic Islands.
            Spain also rules two cities in North Africa and the Canary Islands in the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>The interior of Spain is a high, dry plateau surrounded and crisscrossed by mountain ranges.
            Rivers run to the coasts, creating good farmland.
            Still, the interior of the country gets very hot in summer and very cold and dry in the winter.
            Droughts are common.</p>

          <p>Plants and trees grow so well on the northwestern coast, in Galicia and along the Bay of Biscay,
            that the area is called Green Spain.
            Rain, trapped by the mountains farther inland, is frequent.
            Beech and oak trees flourish here.
            Numerous coves and inlets break up the coastline.</p>

          <p>The southern and eastern coasts of Spain, from the fertile Andalusian plain up to the Pyrenees,
            are often swept by warm winds called sirocco winds.
            These winds originate in northern Africa and keep temperatures
            along the Mediterranean coast milder than the interior.</p>

          <p>
            A link between Europe and Africa, Spain is an important resting spot for migratory birds.
            Spain is also home to such mammals as the wolf, lynx, wildcat, fox, wild boar, deer, hare, and wild goat.
            Streams and lakes shelter trout, barbel, and tench fish.
          </p>
          <p>
            But many species of wildlife face threats from habitat loss and pollution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to centuries of tree cutting, large forests are now found only in the north Pyrenees and the
            Asturias-Galicia area. Planting new trees is difficult where sheep and goats graze. Erosion and river
            pollution are also problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spain has created many national parks and refuges, but they only cover about 7 percent of the country.
            One protected area is Doñana National Park, a region of marshes, streams, and sand dunes where the
            Guadalquivir River flows into the Atlantic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The park's diversity of life is unique in Europe and includes the
            European badger, Egyptian mongoose, and endangered species such as the Spanish imperial eagle and the
            Iberian lynx.
