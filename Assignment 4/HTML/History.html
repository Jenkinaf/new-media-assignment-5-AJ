          <h2 class="blog-post-title">Transition to Democracy </h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            After Franco’s death on November 20, 1975, the accession of Juan Carlos as king opened a new era, which
            culminated in the peaceful transition to democracy by means of the legal instruments of Francoism. This
            strategy made it possible to avoid the perils of the “democratic rupture” advocated by the opposition, which
            had united, uneasily, on a common platform in July 1974. Arias Navarro, incapable of making the democratic
            transition supported by the king, was replaced in July 1976 by Adolfo Suárez González, a former Francoist
            minister. Suárez persuaded the Francoist right in the Cortes to pass the Law for Political Reform (November
            1976), which paved the way for democratic elections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suárez then convinced the opposition of his willingness to negotiate and his democratic intentions; in April
            1977 he legalized the PCE against the wishes of the
            armed forces. In the elections of June 1977, Suárez’s party, a coalition of centrist groups called the Union
            of the Democratic Centre (UCD), emerged as the strongest party, winning 165 seats in the Cortes, closely
            followed by the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE), who captured 118 seats. It was a triumph for
            political moderation and the consensus politics of Suárez. The PCE gained 20 seats and the right-wing
            Popular Alliance 16.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suárez formed a minority government, and the political consensus held to pass the constitution of 1978. The
            new constitution, overwhelmingly ratified in a public referendum in December 1978, established Spain as a
            constitutional monarchy. Church and state were separated, and provisions were made for the creation of 17
            autonomous communities throughout Spain, which extended regional autonomy beyond Euskadi (the Basque
            Country, encompassing the provinces of Viscaya, Guipúzcoa, and Álava) and Catalonia, both of which had
            already been given limited autonomy. Confronted by terrorism and economic recession, the UCD disintegrated
            into the factions of its “barons.” After heavy defeats in local elections and fearing a possible military
            coup, Suárez resigned in January 1981.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inauguration of Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, also a member of the UCD, as prime minister was interrupted by
            the attempted military coup of Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero, who occupied the Cortes (February 23,
            1981) and held the government and the deputies captive for 18 hours. The coup attempt failed, however,
            because of King Juan Carlos’s resolute support of the democratic constitution. Calvo Sotelo, who was left
            with the task of restoring confidence in democracy, successfully engineered Spain’s entry into the North
            Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1982.

          <h2 class="blog-post-title">Spain in the 21st Century</h2>
          <hr>

          <p>
            The new prime minister, José María Aznar, like González, depended on the support of Basque and Catalan
            nationalists (he also secured the support of the small Canary Coalition party), requiring him to alter the
            party’s strident centralist rhetoric. Aznar’s focus on deficit reduction provoked a wave of strikes and
            protests, including demonstrations by government workers, a two-week strike by truck drivers, and, in 1998,
            violent protests by Asturian coal miners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, Aznar’s government reaped political benefits when
            Spain qualified to join the euro, the single currency of the European Union (in which the European Community
            [formerly EEC] was embedded in 1993); it did so by continuing many of the economic policies the Socialists
            had introduced to meet the Maastricht Treaty’s terms for inclusion. It also benefited from a recovery in the
            late 1990s that put the economy on generally firm footing as Spain entered the new millennium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aznar’s PP won a landslide election victory in April 2000, but it continued to face such intractable
            problems as the relationship between the regions and the state, Gibraltar’s status as a British colony, and
            the seemingly eternal scourge of Basque terrorism. International affairs caused domestic political tensions
            to flare in 2003, when Aznar supported the U.S.- and British-led war to oust Ṣaddām Ḥussein’s government in
            Iraq despite opposition by some 90 percent of Spain’s citizens (see Iraq War).
           </p>
            <p>
            On March 11, 2004, 10 bombs
            exploded on four trains in Madrid, killing some 200 people and injuring some 1,500 others in the worst
            terrorist incident in Europe since World War II. In elections held three days later, voters swept the
            governing PP from office in favour of the Socialist Party, led by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.
